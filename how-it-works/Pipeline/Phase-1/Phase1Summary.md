This plan describes **how MCRC will keep track of every person who asks for help**, from their first form all the way until their case is finished.

---

## 1. What this system is

MCRC now has a **case management system**.

Think of it like:

* A **digital filing cabinet** for every person who asks for help
* A **to-do list** for staff
* A **news feed** that shows what is happening in real time

The goal is to make sure **no one “falls through the cracks”**.

---

## 2. What is done so far (Phase 1)

**Phase 1 is finished.**
It covers everything from:

> When a person fills out an online form
> ➜ to when they schedule their intake call
> ➜ and staff are told what to do next

Future parts (like case outcomes and reports) are **not built yet**.

---

## 3. The main problem we are fixing

Before this system:

* Some people **never got a call back**
* Staff could **lose track** of who needed follow-up
* There was no clear way to see **where each case was** in the process

This system fixes that by:

* Giving the Intake Coordinator (IC) a **clear, always-updated to-do list**
* Keeping a **record of every step** for each case

---

## 4. The three main pieces

### A. Case files (Service Areas)

Each person who fills out a form gets a **digital case file**.

You can think of it like a folder that has:

* The person’s **form answers**
* The **type of help** they asked for (mediation, facilitation, etc.)
* The **status** of their case (for example: `submitted`, `intake scheduled`, `in progress`, `closed`)
* If they booked a call, the **date and time of the intake call**

---

### B. Staff To-Do List (Tasks)

Each staff member (like the Intake Coordinator or an admin) has a **personal to-do list** inside the system.

A task might be:

* “Review new mediation inquiry”
* “Call P1 for intake”
* “Follow up after session”

Each task shows:

* What needs to be done
* Who it is for (which case)
* Who it is **assigned to**
* When it was created
* When it is **due**
* Whether it is **pending** or **done**

This keeps the IC’s day **organized and focused**.

---

### C. Activity Feed (Updates for Staff)

Each staff member also has an **activity feed** — like a simple news feed.

It shows updates such as:

* “A new inquiry was submitted.”
* “P1 scheduled their intake call.”
* “Status changed from submitted to intake-scheduled.”

Each update can include a **link** so staff can click and go straight to that case.

This helps staff **see what’s happening right now** without digging around.

---

## 5. What happens in Phase 1 (Step by step)

Phase 1 covers the journey from **form submission** to **intake call scheduled**.

### Step 1: Person fills out the form

* A participant (P1) fills out an online form on the MCRC website.
* It is a **multi-step form** that checks answers as they go.
* When they press **Submit**, the system sends all their answers to the database.

---

### Step 2: Their answers are saved as a case

The system:

* Creates a **new case file** in the correct service area (for example, mediation)
* Stores:

  * All the answers from the form
  * The time it was submitted
  * A starting **status** of `"submitted"`

Now this person is officially **in the system**.

---

### Step 3: Tasks and updates are made for staff (automatically)

Right after the case is created:

* The system finds all **admins and coordinators**
* It **creates new tasks** on their to-do lists, such as:

  * “New inquiry: review and follow up”
* It also adds **activity updates** for staff, such as:

  * “A new intake form was submitted.”

This means the IC does **not** have to go hunting for new cases.
New work **shows up for them automatically**.

---

### Step 4: Person is sent to a Thank You page

After the form is submitted:

* The participant is sent to a **Thank You page** on the website.
* The page knows **which service area** and **which case** they belong to.

---

### Step 5: Participant schedules their intake call (Calendly)

On the Thank You page:

1. The system looks up the **right Calendly link** for that type of case.
2. It shows a **calendar tool** (Calendly) so the person can pick a date and time.
3. When they choose a time, Calendly tells our system:

   * That the intake call was scheduled
   * Exactly **when** it will happen

This makes it easy for participants to **book right away**, without waiting for someone to call them first.

---

### Step 6: System updates tasks when the call is scheduled

After the call is booked:

1. The case file is updated:

   * Status changes (for example, to “intake-scheduled”)
   * The date and time of the call are saved
2. The system **closes** the old task (“new inquiry”)
3. It creates a **new task** like:

   * “Do intake call for [Participant Name]”
4. It adds a new activity update:

   * “P1 has scheduled their intake.”

So staff always know:

* **What just happened**
* **What they need to do next**

---

### Step 7: Tasks stay organized with filters and sharing

We also added new tools that make the Intake Coordinator’s task board easier to use:

* There is now a **task list page** that shows open and recently finished tasks.
* Staff can **search** their tasks or **filter** by service area, task type, or priority.
* The filters now live in the page link (the URL). That means staff can **share a link** like `/dashboard/tasks?service=mediation&priority=high` and everyone will see the same filtered view.
* A **sort button** lets them pick how the list is ordered, such as “Due soon,” “Priority high to low,” or “Most recently assigned.”
* The main dashboard now has **quick stat cards** that show how many tasks are pending, how many new inquiries came in this week, and how many intakes got scheduled.

These updates help the IC spot urgent work fast and keep teammates on the same page.

---

## 6. What will come later (Future Phases)

Future phases will build on this system to handle:

* Intake call **outcomes** (for example, “move forward” or “not suitable for mediation”)
* **Onboarding** both participants
* **Case progression** (sessions, follow-ups, and closing cases)
* **Evaluations** from participants and mediators
* **Reports and dashboards** (to see trends and impact over time)

Phase 1 is the **foundation**:
It makes sure **every new person** who reaches out is captured, scheduled, and followed up with.
